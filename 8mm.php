						<p class="large">Frequently Asked Questions</p>
						<h4>What is the 8mm Distress Kit - what am I getting for my money?</h4>
						<p>The 8mm Distress Kit 4k is a collection of original video clips, scanned from vintage 8mm film at 3840 x 2160. The clips can be overlaid on video footage and transitions to give organic, analogue 8mm film effects.<p>
						The Distress Kit comes in 2 versions;<p>

					8mm Distress Kit 4k_CLASSIC has 32 clips, a 5.16GB download.<p>

					8mm Distress Kit 4k_PREMIUM has the 32 clips from the CLASSIC version plus an additional 32 - 64 in total, a 4.5GB download.<p>

					The clips range from 1 sec to 1 minute 37 secs in length and are divided into 5 folders - Damage, Light Leaks, Numbers and Text, Grunge and Transitions.</p>
											<h4>What is the resolution, file format and frame rate?</h4>
											<p>4k 3840 x 2160. The video codec is Photo JPEG. The frame rate is 25fps - this can be modified for use in other frame rate projects</p>
											<h4>What platform and applications can they be used with?</h4>
											
						<p>The clips are cross-platform and can be used with any NLE and motion graphic application that supports, composite, blending or transfer modes. The system needs to be able to support 4K footage. We suggest downloading the free samples to test.</p>
						<h4>What's the quality like?</h4>
						<p>The files are made using the best possible quality, scans from 8mm film. Given that they are deliberately chosen to 'distress' they can be used within most settings.</p>
						<h4>What is the upgrade path?</h4>
						<p>Customers who have purchased the CLASSIC any other previous version of the Distress Kit can upgrade to the PREMIUM version at any time. We need the email adress that was used to make the original purchase. Once payment is complete we will send a link to the PREMIUM 4k files.<p>
						<h4>How do I pay? - what happens next?</h4>
						<p>Payment is by PayPal via e-junkie, (you don't need a PayPal account) after you have paid you will automatically be directed to a link where you can download the 8mm Distress Kit_ 4K.</p>

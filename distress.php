						<p>Frequently Asked Questions - Some things we often get asked about the 8mm Distress Kit</p>
					</div> <!-- col-4 -->
					<div class="col-6">
						<h4>What is the 8mm Distress Kit - what am I getting for my money?</h4>
						<p>The 8mm Distress Kit is a pack of 28 original video clips, scaned from vintage 8mm film. The Distress Kit comes in 2 versions; HD 29.97 fps, a 1.4gb download and HD 25 fps, a 1gb download. The pack consists of 2 Quicktime files called Strip1 &amp; 2. There are 14 clips to each strip, ranging from 1 to 20 secs in length. The clips can be overlaid on video footage and transitions to give organic, analogue 8mm film effects.</p>
						<h4>What is the resolution and file format?</h4>
						<p>HD 1920 x 1080 29.97 fps HD 1920 x 1080 25 fps. The video codec is Photo JPEG.</p>
						<h4>Why the black boarder?</h4>
						<p>8mm cine is a square(ish) format. The clips are supplied 'as is', to give the user as much flexibility as possible, when using the clips with various video formats.</p>
						<h4>What platform and applications can they be used with?</h4>
						<p>The clips are cross-platform and can be used with any NLE and motion graphic application that supports, composite, blending or transfer modes.</p>
						<h4>What's the quality like?</h4>
						<p>The files are made using the best possible quality, scans from 8mm film. Given that they are deliberately chosen to 'distress' they can be used within most settings.</p>
